1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,333


2
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:05,566
Now let's be interested in some of properties
of complex numbers.

3
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:09,699
Concerning geometric symmetries,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,166
Let me recall the exponential form:
if z is r exp(i theta)

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:20,666
then r is the modulus of z,
and theta is the argument of z.

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:27,932
We know that the conjugate of z
equals r exp(-i theta).

7
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:34,366
Therefore we can see that z and the conjugate of z
have the same modulus, the same radius.

8
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:37,666
However the argument of the conjugate of z

9
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:42,132
equals the opposite of the argument of z.

10
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:44,466
Then for negative z,

11
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:50,199
negative z can be written like that,
but we know that -1 equals exp( i Pi).

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,500
Therefore the exponential form of -z

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:00,700
is equal to that.
And again we can see that
the modulus of -z is equal to the modulus of z,

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:09,366
but the argument of -z
is equal to arg(z) to which you have to add Pi.

15
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:14,366
Geometrically,
here we've put a point M in the plane R^2.

16
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:19,399
 This point M also represents a complex number,
called the affix of M over here.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,166
If you take the symmetric point,
with respect to the x-acis, then

18
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:29,532
the affix of M'
is exactly equal to

19
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:37,033
the conjugate of the affix of M.
Namely z' = the conjugate of z.

20
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:42,299
Now if you take the symmetric point
with respect to the origin,

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,400
of M, then its affix

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,500
equals -z.
From z, we've drawn the conjugate of z

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,966
the both numbers have the same modulus,
in contrast with the argument which are opposite.

24
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:04,566
Then, for z'' namely -z

25
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:08,666
we also have the same modulus,
however

26
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:13,299
the relation between the two angles,
is the angle theta over here

27
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,966
to which you add Pi
to get the angle of M''.

28
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,199
That's it for the symmetries.

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,533
Now let's focus on 
the simplification of two complex numbers.

30
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:32,899
This is a very common trick:
you can simplify 2-i over 1+3i

31
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,300
in other words, 
to give the standard form of this complex number.

32
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:45,700
How to do that?
There's a way which always works:
you have to multiply above and below

33
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,500
by the conjugate

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:58,633
of the complex number below.
Here you have to multiply by 1-3i
(which is the conjugate of 1+3i).

35
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:06,566
Indeed we know that 
z times the conjugate of z equals
the modulus of z squared.

36
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:10,199
Here the value is 10.

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,766
Above, after simplification,
we get -1-7i.
Then we separe real and imaginary parts

38
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:24,999
to get the standard form of the complex number
like this.
