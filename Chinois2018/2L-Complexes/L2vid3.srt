00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,666


2
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:07,132
In this video we're going to see
an example of use of Euler's and de Moivre's formula.

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:14,199
We know to linearize cosine to the third of x.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,566
To linearize means to rewrite
this quantity like

5
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:25,166
a function of trigonometric functions,
without power (2 ou 3 ...).

6
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:33,599
For this we need 3 tools.
The first one is Euler's formula (for cosine)

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,800
recalled over there.
The second one is de Moivre's formula,

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,333
we'll need the power 3,
because we have the power 3 at the beginning.

9
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:50,666
At last, the third tool
is the development

10
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:55,466
thanks to the Binomial's formula
(a+b)^3 = ...

11
00:00:55,466 --> 00:01:00,266
The power 3 is 
because we have the power 3 at the beginning.

12
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:06,599
How can we proceed ?
The first thing to do is to replace

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,966
the cosine by exponential
(thanks to Euler's formula).

14
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:21,166
The number below
can be put outside

15
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:26,632
and we get 1/2 to the third,
that is 1/8.

16
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:30,433
Let's now focus on the parentheses over here.

17
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:39,999
We have to develop something like (a+b)^3:
here we use the Binomial's formula.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,300
This formula provides us
this development. 

19
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:53,066
Here is the a to the third
+ 3 a squared times b
+3 a times b squared + b to the third.

20
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:58,366
Now we have to simplify
these expressions ...

21
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:06,966
... using de Moivre's formula. 
This formula says that the powers can be written
inside the exponential.

22
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:12,332
After simplification, 
we get this expression.

23
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,533
Once we've done this simplification,

24
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:21,166
there is one last step:
to use Euler's formula in reserve

25
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:25,466
namely to take the same exponentials

26
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:31,799
to form trigonometric functions.

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:41,466
For example, exp(i 3x) and exp(-i 3x)
gather together to a cosine.

28
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:50,266
In the same way, exp(i x) and exp(-i x)
gather together to a cosine too.

29
00:02:50,266 --> 00:03:00,632
Therefore, 
using the reverse of Euler's formula,
we see that the sum of exp(i 3x) and exp(-i 3x)

30
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:03,366
equals 2 times cosine of 3x.

31
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:13,066
The sum of exp(i x) and exp(-i x)
equals 2 times cosine of x
(up to the factor 3).

32
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:19,966
After simplification
we get the following expression.

33
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:29,232
Finally, cosine to the third of x
equals 1/4 times cosine of 3x + 3/4 times cosine of x.

34
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:35,433
We've linearized cosine to the third
because in the last expression, there isn't any more power.
