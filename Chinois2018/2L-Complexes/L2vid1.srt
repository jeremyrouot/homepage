00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:04,066
This chapter concerns complex numbers.

3
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:10,732
We're going to see in this first video
different forms of some complex number,
then we'll give some symmetry properties

4
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:15,166
for some complex number.
In the third video,

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:19,632
we'll see an application of
Euler's and Moivre's formula.

6
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:24,966
There exists 2 main forms
of a complex number:
the standard form

7
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:30,332
and the exponential form.

8
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:38,433
How to pass from standard form to exponential form?
Here is a complex number in standard form,
with 1 as its real part,

9
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:46,533
and -sqrt(3) its imaginary part.
How can you find the exponential form?

10
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:49,099
For this, you have to compute
two things:

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,566
the radius r, which actually is the modulus of z,
and then the argument of z.

12
00:00:54,566 --> 00:01:00,166
We always begin to compute r,
which

13
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:06,832
is actually the modulus of z:
we have an explicit formula that tells us

14
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:13,499
the modulus is the square root of
the real part squared, that is 1 squared +

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,033
the imaginary part squared,
that is the square root of 3 squared.

16
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:22,566
It comes 2.
Once we have the modulus r,

17
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,999
we can compute the argument of z.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,166
It's called theta.
The argument must satisfy two things:

19
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:40,266
its cosine equals the real part of z
divided by its modulus (1/2),

20
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:47,032
its sinus equals the imaginary part of z
again divided by its modulus.

21
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:48,899
It comes a equations system,

22
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,366
which admits only 1 solution
up to 2kPi.

23
00:01:54,366 --> 00:02:03,999
Generally, you can take the solution
either between 0 and 2Pi
or between -Pi and Pi. (there is no preference)

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,566
Here the solution is -Pi/3 (or -Pi/3+2Pi):

25
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,899
there is a choice to do.

26
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,266
Once you have found the angle theta
(or the argument of z)

27
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:27,632
We know how to write the complex number
in the trigonometric form

28
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:33,533
(which is the modulus multiplied by
cosine of the argument + i times sinus of the argument)

29
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:45,466
and its exponential form is:
the modulus multiplied by exp(i times argument).

30
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:50,999
It's easier to change the exponential form
into the standard form.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,533
Here is a complex number in standard form.

32
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,999
It's straightforward to identify

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,933
the modulus: it's the square root of 2
and the angle (the argument): 

34
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,999
here is Pi/4.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,333
From this, we find the standard form:
z equals

36
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:25,333
its modulus (sqrt(2)) multiplied by
cosine of the argument (cos(Pi/4))

37
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:31,333
+ i times its modulus (again)
multiplied by sinus of the argument.

38
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:37,699
We know the correspondant usual values

39
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,066
and we get for both sqrt(2)/2,
and after simplification

40
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:48,032
we get the standard form of z: 1+i.
