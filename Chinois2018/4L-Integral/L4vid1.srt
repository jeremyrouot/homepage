1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,166


2
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:06,599
This lesson is about integrals and primitives.
We'll give the relation between these two objects.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:14,800
In this first video, we're going to talk about integral,
to give a definition and some properties.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,266
Then we're going to see how to compute
the integrale of some constant function.

5
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:25,499
Here is a graph of some positive function f.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,766
It means the graph is above the x-axis.

7
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:36,199
We're interested in the area below the graph:
namely between the graph and the x-axis

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,666
delimited by two points:
a=1 and b=5.

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:47,099
That area, that quantity,
is denoted like this.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,966
It depends on a and b 
but also on the function f.

11
00:00:54,966 --> 00:01:04,166
We read the number like:
the integral from a to b of f (x) dx.

12
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,366
It can be computed and here the value is 10.88.

13
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:11,232
For negative function,

14
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:20,299
we're interested in the area but this time
above the graph (between the graph and the x-axis).

15
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:32,033
That area is a positive number,
but the integral from a to b of f(x) 

16
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:39,499
is going to be a negative number.
Actually the integral of a negative function
is the opposite of the value of the area.

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,733
Here it comes -10.88.

18
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:48,133
A first property:

19
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:54,133
Here is the graph of some positive function,

20
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:59,499
and we're looking to compute the area 
between a and b of this function.

21
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
It is easy to figure out that

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:13,200
when we cut the interval a,b into two intervals a,c and c,b
the area below the graph

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:24,733
between a and b equals
the area between a and c + the area between c and b.
These two area in green and red can be denoted by

24
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:32,433
integrals:
here is the integral between a and c
and here is the integral between c and b.

25
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:41,333
If you compute a1+a1 (the areas),
then you get 10.35

26
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:50,599
And moving c
is going to change a1 and a2, 
but the sum a1+a2 doesn't change.

27
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,933
This result is actually the integral
between a and b.

28
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,799
This relation is called
Chasles' relation.

29
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:05,366
The integral between a and b equals
the integral between a and c + the integral between c and b

30
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:11,032
whatever the point c.

31
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,499
Let's continue by

32
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:21,400
the computation of the integral of some constant.
It is very important and you have to know how to do it quickly.

33
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,633
The formula is the following:

34
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:33,933
the integral between a and b of c
is equal to b-a (the length of the intervall a,b)

35
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:41,266
multiplied by the constant c inside the integral.

36
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:47,632
Actually to compute the integral of some constant

37
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,399
(because a constant function is a horizontal line)

38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:01,133
the area below the line is the area of a rectangle.

39
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:05,799
Area of a rectangle is well-known:

40
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:14,300
the base (here is b-a that is 5-1)

41
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:26,266
times the height 
(here is the value of the constant minus 0, that is c)

42
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:39,999
At last, the integral of a constant c between 1 and 5,
is equal to 5-1 times the height c.
