00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,466


2
00:00:00,466 --> 00:00:05,866
In this video, we're going to see
the notion of primitives.
At the beginning, we'll give some examples

3
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:11,266
of computation of primitives.
Then we'll show the relation with computation of integrals.

4
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:16,432
A primitive of some function f
is an other function F

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:21,599
such that if you take the derivative of F
then you get f.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,600
For instance,
looking for a primitive of f(x)=2x

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,600
is looking for a function F,
such that the derivative of F is 2x.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:40,300
We can take for example F(x)=x squared.
When you take the derivative of F, 
you get 2x.

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:49,500
Be careful, there isn't unicity
of the primitive F: 
it's enough to add some constant C to F

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,666
to get another primitive of f.
Indeed if you derivate x squared + C

11
00:00:55,666 --> 00:01:00,066
the constant +C vanishes when you derivate.

12
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:04,499
An other example: 
the function g(x) = 2/x

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,366
The constant 2 can be set aside.

14
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:17,399
What is, when you take the derivative,
gives us 1/x?
We know the result has the form ln.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:25,466
ln(x) but you have to add the constant 2,
in front of ln(x).

16
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:29,899
When you take the derivative of 2 ln(x),
you get 2/x.

17
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,866
Do not forget the constant C.

18
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:38,432
We're changing the variable

19
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:47,533
There is a constant 3, we ca set aside.
What is, when you take the derivative,
gives us 1/t squared?

20
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:50,833
The result is - 1/t.

21
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:59,399
-1/t with the constant 3 here,
plus C.

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
A last example:

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:11,100
what is, when you take the derivative,
gives us exp?
A exp always gives us exp too

24
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:21,366
with a constant you have to determine in front of it.
Therefore exp of t/2 becomes exp of t/2
(it doesn't change)

25
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:24,599
But imagine I did'nt put the 2 here,

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,366
if you derivate exp of t/2,
you actually derivate a function like exp of u,

27
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:38,299
and because the derivative of exp u
is u' times exp u,

28
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,900
the u' here is 1/2.

29
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,300
But there is no 1/2 and then
you have to multiply the primitive by 2. 

30
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,966
And we add the constant C.

31
00:02:54,966 --> 00:03:03,299
How to apply these computation of primitives
to computation of integrals?

32
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,666
This is given by the fundamental analys theorem,
which relies integral with primitive.

33
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:13,499
To compute this integral,

34
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,866
we can find a primitive 
of the function x times exp of x^2.

35
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:24,732
This function over here

36
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:31,166
has actually the form 
exp of u where u is x squared

37
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:39,899
and in front of the exp
is almost u' (up to a constant 2).

38
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,866
We have x,
 nevertheless it doesn't matter:
up to a constant we could have 2x.

39
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:51,832
This function has then the form:
u' times exp(u).

40
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:56,199
We know a primitive of u' times exp(u)

41
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:07,233
It is exp(u)
up to a constant 1/2 
(because 2 is missing).

42
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:10,866
This integral equals bracket

43
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:20,799
of some primitive we've found 1/2 exp x^2
(without any constant).

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:28,066
This bracket is taken between 0 and 2,
which are the two limits of the integral respectively.

45
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:34,232
The bracket means: 
we can develop it

46
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:45,099
into the function taken at 
the upper bound of the bracket, that is 2

47
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:52,400
minus the same function
taken at the lower bound of the bracket, 0.

48
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,000
We simplify theses quantities,
and we get

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,400
One half times exp of 4 minus one half.

50
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:09,600
This integral, namely the area 
below the graph of this function between 0 and 2, 

51
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,766
equals this value.

52
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:16,632
A second example.

53
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:22,399
We need to compute a primitive
of ln of x over x.

54
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,966
First, it isn't necessarly obvious,
but we can rewrite this integral

55
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:37,532
separating the quotient to a product:
1/x times ln(x).

56
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:42,133
If you set u equals ln(x),

57
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:51,299
it turns out that 1/x is exactly u'.
Then the function has the form u' times u.

58
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,333
And u' times u has a well-known primitive.

59
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:09,866
It is u squared
with 1/2 in front of it.
(because the derivative of u squared is 2u times u')

60
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:16,166
Here 2 is missing, 
so you have to add 1/2 to get the right value.

61
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:22,066
So the derivative of ln(x) squared over 2
is precisely the function over here.

62
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:29,166
And we need to develop the bracket:

63
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:35,932
we begin with the upper bound, 
ln of e squared minus

64
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:42,333
the function taken at the lower bound 1.

65
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:47,599
We know that ln of 1 is zero
and ln of e is 1

66
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,033
So the value of the integral
is 1/2.
