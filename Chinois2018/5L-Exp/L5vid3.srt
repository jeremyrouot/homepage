1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,666


2
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:07,466
In this video, we're going to show
how to solve an equation which involves ln.

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:15,066
and then an example
of a resolution of some inequation which involves exp.

4
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:20,066
In the first example,
we're looking to solve this equation.

5
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:28,832
We proceed in two parts:
the first one is to determine the set of definition of this equation.

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:38,466
Because of the ln here
(which is a function well-defined on positive numbers)

7
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:46,499
what is inside of ln, has to be a positive number.
This equation provides us two constraints:

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,333
x has to be a positive number
and 1 over x has to be a positive number too.

9
00:00:53,333 --> 00:01:01,966
These two constraints can be group together:
1/x > 0 is actually

10
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:07,732
equivalent to x >0.
So these two constraints are the same.

11
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:13,299
Together, it gives us x > 0.

12
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:21,400
This first part is very important.
Once it's done, we come back to the equation.

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,866
When it is possible,
we always

14
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:29,632
put the equation in the following form:
ln equals ln.

15
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:39,133
Then we can apply the exponential on both sides,
because we know that 
exp of ln of a equals a.

16
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,333
It allows us to remove the ln().

17
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:47,833
That's what we do here,
we get this equation is equivalent to 

18
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:53,333
x equals 1/x.
This equivalence is only true on

19
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,999
domain of definition given above.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,500
You have to keep in mind that
x has to be a positive number.

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,466
We now focus on solving
this new equation.

22
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:07,532
To this aim, we can
multiply both sides by x.

23
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:10,233
We get x squared equals 1.

24
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,966
This equation

25
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:17,699
admits two real solutions: + or - 1.

26
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,800
But we remind that x is in the domain,
it has to be a positive number.

27
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,233
Finally there is only one solution.

28
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:32,033
In other words, 
S equals 1.

29
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:36,899
For the second example,
we want to solve this inequation.

30
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,533
The variable here is phi.

31
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:48,966
In the same way, 
the first part is to determine 
the domain of definition of this inequation.

32
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:54,099
Because of the quotient,
exp of phi + 1 hasn't to be zero.

33
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,800
But exp of phi is always a positive number,
for any value of phi,

34
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,566
therefore this number isn't equal to zero.

35
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:09,366
This constraint isn't a true constraint.

36
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:13,932
It doesn't give us a constraint over phi.
Besides the exponential function is defined on R.

37
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,899
So phi can be any real number.

38
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:23,333
So phi belongs to R.
We have no restriction for this inequation.

39
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,633
Then, like previously,

40
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:32,366
because of the quotient here,

41
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:44,799
the idea is to multiply both sides
by exp of phi +1.

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:54,000
This doesn't change the sign of the inequality,
because exp of phi + 1 is a positive number.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,233
Once we did this,

44
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:09,133
we group exp of phi together.
It gives us 1 exp of phi on the right hand side

45
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:18,966
and for the constant,
on the left hand side, 
we get 1.

46
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:23,732
How to get the constraint on phi?

47
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,733
It is enough now

48
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:30,166
to take ln to both sides
of the inequality.

49
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:36,466
We can do that because 
ln is an increasing function:
so the inequality doesn't change.

50
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:38,132
Therefore we get

51
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:47,299
ln of 1, that is 0, 
has to be greater than ln of exp of phi,
that is phi.

52
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,866
Finally

53
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:52,766
the set of solutions of this inequation

54
00:04:52,766 --> 00:05:00,599
is the set of phi which are negative numbers,
in other words, - infinity to 0.

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,033
The constraint here is respected.
