1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,633


2
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:07,699
During this video, we're going to see
how to compute limits in which exp and ln occur.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:14,966
The first point is about
compared growths: they compare
exp, ln functions with respect to power functions.

4
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:19,832
Then we'll give another example
of computation of some limit.

5
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:26,066
Here are the graph of exp (in black)
and the graph of ln (in violet).

6
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:35,966
These functions are symmetric w.r.t to the line y=x.
Now we draw power functions.

7
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:41,666
In green is the function x to the power 1.06.

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:47,899
We can change the power:
while the power is increasing,

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:54,166
we notice that the green function 
is approaching the graph of exp.

10
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:58,832
But when x tends to +infinity,

11
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:06,199
exponential function increases
more quickly than any power functions
(in +infinity)

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,500
This a property we can write:

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,033
the quotient of exp of x and power function x to alpha

14
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:24,866
tends to +infinity
when x tends to +infinity.

15
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:29,732
It means that the exponential function
is "stronger" than any power function.

16
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:36,733
Now
when power decreases,

17
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:43,466
in the same way, graphs of power functions
are approaching the graph of ln.

18
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:51,766
But
when x tends to +infinity,
for any power here,

19
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:57,066
logarithm function tends to +infinity
more slowly than power function.

20
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:04,766
In other words, we can translate 
this property into a limit of quotient.

21
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:12,666
The quotient of ln of x over x to alpha,
for any alpha,
when x tends to +infinity,

22
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,999
is going to zero.
It means that ln is always "weaker" than

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,366
any power functions in +infinity.

24
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:28,566
That is a first use of these functions
for computation of some limits.

25
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:34,732
Second example:
how to compute this kind of limit?

26
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:39,433
The first thing you have to ask yourself is:
can you compute it without transformation?

27
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:47,833
We notice that in the first part,
it is the x squared which matters in +infinity,
so it goes to +infinity.

28
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:52,766
Because of the square root,
all of this tends to +infinity.

29
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:57,399
Here we have a "minus x",
which tends to - infinity.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:06,000
Therefore we have the (undefined) form:
+ infinity - infinity

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,866
To compute this kind of limit,
we then have to transform the quantity.

32
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:17,266
So

33
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:27,532
this is a classical operation,
because we have a square root of something minus something

34
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:38,333
So we multiply this quantity inside ln by
its conjugate quantity.

35
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:43,199
The conjugate quantity of
sqrt a - sqrt b is
sqrt a + sqrt b.

36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,200
To not change the value,
we have to multiply both above and below
by the same thing.

37
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,533
We multiply by 
the square root of x squared + x -1
plus x.

38
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:59,199
Above we get a classical polynomial identity,
which is

39
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,766
(sqrt a - sqrt b) times (sqrt a + sqrt b)
is actually a - b.

40
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:10,666
Because of the squared,
we can remove the square root here.

41
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:15,032
And x becomes x squared.

42
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:20,599
We can simplify and we obtain this.

43
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,266
Once we have this form,

44
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:35,832
we can factor above and below
by the biggest power we can find.

45
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,133
Above the biggest power is x.

46
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:45,466
Below,
the biggest power inside the square root
is x squared.

47
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:52,699
After factor, we get his,
and now we put the x squared in front of the square root.

48
00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:03,066
Keep in mind that square root of x squared
is the absolute value of x.

49
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:12,166
But here we're interested in the limit
when x tends to +infinity.
Hence x will be a positive number.

50
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:19,032
So in this case,
you can remove the absolute value.

51
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:30,199
At last, we can simplify all of these x.

52
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,800
We get
this quantity over here.
(after simplification)

53
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:45,966
Notice that the new quantity is easier than the first one.

54
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:55,999
Indeed, 
it is easier to find the limit of this quantity:
when x tends to +infinity, above is going to 1,

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,966
and below, 
we get 1 + square root of 1
(all of this tends to zero).

56
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:08,266
Then square root of 1 plus 1 is 2.

57
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:14,199
So the limit of ln of this quotient
is going to be ln of 1 over 2.

58
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:21,000
Thanks to the ln properties,
we get - ln of 2.
