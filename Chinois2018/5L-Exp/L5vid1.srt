00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,533


2
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:03,866
This lesson concerns
exponential and logarithm functions.

3
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:07,832
In this first video, we'll be interested
in some properties.

4
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:15,699
Then we'll see an example of compared growths
and finally some examples of equations and inequations.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:22,900
Concerning properties,
here are some propositions.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,300
You have to find those which are true,
and those which are false.
The first one is the following:

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,700
for all real numbers a and b,
exp of a+b equals this big square root.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,066
This proposition is true.

9
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:46,032
To justify this, you can simplify
the right hand side, recalling
properties of powers.

10
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:52,333
For example, if x is exp of 2a
and y is exp of 2b,

11
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:56,933
we recall that the square root
of x squared times y squared

12
00:00:56,933 --> 00:01:03,333
is actually the same as 
x squared times y squared,
all of this to the power 1/2.

13
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:07,966
With power properties, 
we can say that it is the same as

14
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:12,599
x squared to the 1/2
times y squared to the 1/2

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,533
the squared followed by 1/2
can be simplified as 2 times 1/2.

16
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:24,466
We get x to the power of 2 times 1/2,

17
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:31,199
that is x, 
times y to the power of 2 times 1/2, that is y.

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:40,733
This quantity over here 
equals exp of a times exp of b,
namely exp of a + b.

19
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,899
It is true.

20
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:52,733
Second proposition:
for any real numbers a and b,
we have this equality.

21
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:56,499
Here the relation is false.

22
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,466
To prove that a relation is false,
it is enough to give a counter-example.

23
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:10,099
In other words, it is enough to find
a real number a and a real number b,
for which the relation isn't true.

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:17,733
There is many examples.
We can take a equals 1 and b equals -1.

25
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:24,133
When we replace into it,
we get 2 times exp of 0, that is 2.

26
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:30,833
And on the right hand side,
we get exp of 2 + exp of -2.

27
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:37,166
The value of exp of 2
is approximately 7.39.

28
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:42,266
You add exp of -2.
Its value doesn't matter because

29
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:47,399
it is a positive number. 
So we have 7.39 + something of positive

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,333
has to be equal to 2.

31
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:57,833
It's impossible: there is a contradiction.
So the proposition is false.

32
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,899
Third example:
there exists 

33
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,233
a real number a and a real number b,
which satisfy the same relation as above.

34
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:12,166
What has changed is 
for any to there exists.

35
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:17,099
Can we find two real numbers which satisfy that?

36
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,133
Now, the answer is yes.

37
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:25,733
It is enough to take for example
a equals 0, and b equals 0.

38
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:30,933
On the left hand side,
we get 2 times exp of 0, that is 2,

39
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:36,599
has to be equal to
exp of 0, that is 1, plus exp of 0, that is 1,

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,866
and the result is also 2.
This proposition is true.

41
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:45,999
Last proposition:
there exists a real number a and a real number b

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,133
such that the inequality holds.
This one is a little bit more tricky.

43
00:03:53,133 --> 00:04:01,133
The answer is no:
they don't exist, 
this inequality is never true.

44
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:09,999
Notice that the following inequality always holds:
(exp of a minus exp of b) squared is non-negative.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,333
And we can develop it,

46
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:22,666
so we get exp of 2 a 
minus 2 times exp of a exp of b

47
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:29,399
plus exp of 2b,
has to be a non-negative number.

48
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Then we can move 
2 exp of a exp of b
to the other side.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,866
We get the reverse of the previous
inequality, for any value of a and b.

50
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:48,999
This last inequality is false.
