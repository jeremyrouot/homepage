1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,466


2
00:00:00,466 --> 00:00:06,632
Most of functions we meet
depend on not only one but on many variables.

3
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:11,033
You have to know how to compute the derivative
of some function, depending on many variables,

4
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:14,533
with respect to one of the given variable.

5
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,566
We're going to see this through 2 examples.

6
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:20,799
Let's look this first function f.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:31,133
It depends on t and x.
The x over here is the variable against which
we have to take the derivative of f.

8
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:38,199
Therefore the only variable which matters here is x.
And all the other variables are considered as a parameter,

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,933
in other words as a constant.
How to take the derivative of f with respect to x?

10
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:48,599
In red is what is depending on x.
The rest of it is a constant.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,366
Taking the derivative of f w.r.t x,
we have to take the derivative of exp(x)
(the t in front of it is a constant)

12
00:00:55,366 --> 00:01:02,132
 The constant t stays in the same place.
It's similar for the t squared.

13
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:09,466
The derivative of f w.r.t. x is then
t times exp(x)
(because the derivative of exp(x) is exp(x))

14
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:19,332
 plus a constant times x
which becomes the constant:
that is t squared.

15
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,766
Now we're interested in the same function

16
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:28,066
and we would like to take the derivative of it
with respect to t.

17
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:35,399
This time roles are exchanged:
what isn't t is considered as a constant.

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,300
Hence exp(x) is a constant
and the derivative of t times exp(x)

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,233
is the constant exp(x).

20
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:51,066
And the derivative of t squared times x,
it comes 2 t times the constant.

21
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:59,632
Notice that for the same function,
the derivatives are not the same according to
the choice of the variable.

22
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:08,099
At last, with the same expression,
let's consider a third function
depending on the variable a.

23
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:15,566
Because the function is depending on a
and a is not explicit in the expression,

24
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:23,132
all of this is considered as a constant
(w.r.t. a)
and taking the derivative of h w.r.t. a

25
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:27,933
is taking the derivative of a constant,
so the result is 0.

26
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:31,166
Here is a second and little more tricky example.

27
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:40,366
One more time, we have an expression
which depend on t and x.
We would like to take the derivative w.r.t. x.

28
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:46,732
In red is what depends on x,
the rest of it doesn't depend on x

29
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:54,733
and is considered as a constant.
Hence cos(t^2) is a constant here

30
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:59,166
as well as the square root of t.
Both will appear in the derivative.

31
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:05,966
Now we have to take the derivative of ln(x) squared.
ln(x) squared has the form u squared.

32
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:08,099
The derivative of u squared

33
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:18,300
equals 2 u times u'.
We get 2 ln(x) times the derivative of ln(x),
which is 1 over x.

34
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:27,800
The constant is multiplied by
2 u (2 ln(x) ) times u' (1/x).

35
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:37,900
+ the derivative of some constant times 1 / x:
the constant is the same and the derivative of 1/x
is - 1/x squared.

36
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,966
This can be written as the following.
(it's not an obligation)

37
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:51,599
Now we take the derivative of the same function
but this time depending on t.

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,400
This time roles are exchanged:
what isn't depending on t is considered as a constant.

39
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,933
Hence ln(x)^2 is a constant,
as well as 1 over x.

40
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:08,733
We have to take the derivative of cos(t^2),
namely cos(u).

41
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:15,699
The derivative of cos(u)
is - sin(u) times u'.

42
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,033
Here u is t squared, 
u' is then 2t.

43
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:29,366
Then we get something like that:
- sin(u) times u' times the constant

44
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:40,199
+ the constant 1/x
times the derivative of square root of t,
which is 1 over 2 square root of .

45
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,000
All of this can be written like that.
