00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,533


2
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:07,599
In this video, we're going to give a relationship
between the sign of the derivative of some function
and the variations of the function.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,233
Then we're going to talk geometrically
about the existence of local extrema.

4
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:21,699
Here is a green function f,
it's f(x) = sin(x/2).

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,700
We've put a point A on the graph.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:32,566
We've drawn the orange tangent line 
to the graph at this point A.

7
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:40,299
Recall that the slope of the tangent line is precisely
the derivative of f taken at this point.

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:47,166
For instance, the slope of this tangent line
is f ' of zero.

9
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:51,066
Because the tangent line
is an increasing function

10
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:58,599
we know that its slope is a positive number,
therefore f '(0) is a positive number.

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,033
I'm going to move the point A,
the tangent line is progressively changing.

12
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:09,966
During this, we're going to represent

13
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:14,899
the values of f '(x),
in other words the values of the slope of the tangent line.

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,700
We've already said that is the slope is a positive number.

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:29,333
Progressively, my tangent line is changing a little bit,
but the slopes are still positive numbers.

16
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:35,999
There are represented in violet.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,533
I keep going to move
and there exists a moment where the tangent line
becomes a horizontal line.

18
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:52,633
This a critical point:
precisely when my tangent line becomes
a horizontal line

19
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:59,899
the slope vanishes, 
namely f '(x) equals 0.

20
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:07,700
If I continue to move the point A,
then the tangent line
is becoming a decreasing function.

21
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:16,833
In other words its slope is becoming a negative number.
It impacts the sign of the derivative of f.

22
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,033
From this,
there is a first thing

23
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:37,133
we can say:
f is an increasing function (until over here)
if and only if f '(x) is a positive number.

24
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:48,599
Then f is becoming a decreasing function (until over here)
if and only if f '(x) is a negative number.

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,366
This is the first fact we can say.

26
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:57,066
The second fact:
If I come back to the critical point,

27
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:05,132
Just before this critical point 
where the tangent line is a horizontal line,
we have f '(x) is a positive number.

28
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:08,633
Then f '(x) vanishes and

29
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:16,366
becomes a negative number.
In other words, f '(x) has its sign which changes
(from positive to negative).

30
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:21,766
This means that f
admits a local extremum at this point

31
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:28,466
exactly where the derivative vanishes.

32
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:34,332
(the derivative vanishes at this point)
There are 2 kind of extrema:

33
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:40,199
minimum and maximum. 
The nature can be determined geometrically.

34
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,766
Here it turns out that it's a maximum,

35
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:48,866
called a local maximum:
we know what is happening around A

36
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:56,899
but earlier or later the function could be 
greater than this value.

37
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,166
We have the same fact in this side.

38
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:08,366
The derivative vanishes, 
a little bit before it is a negative number,
a little bit after it is a positive number.

39
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:15,399
Therefore we have an extremum:
it turns out that it is a minimum.

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,666
And the important fact

41
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:27,632
is that there is no extremum elsewhere.

42
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:37,499
If the derivative doesn't vanishe then
we know that f doesn't admit neither minimum nor maximum.
