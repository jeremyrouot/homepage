1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700


2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,933
We're going to see how to solve trigonometric equations.
One knows very well how to solve equation:
cos()=cos()

3
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:10,066
We have a formula for this.
We also know how to solve equation:

4
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:13,199
sin()=sin(),
we have an other formula for this.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,533
However we do not know how to solve directly
cos()=sin()

6
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:21,899
We'll see that we'll need one of the previous form.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,666
Let's focus on this trigonometric equation.

8
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,899
To solve this trigonometric equation,
is to find

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,666
all the x values 
for which the equality is true.

10
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:36,066
To solve this equation, 
the first thing to do is to change

11
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:40,299
the value sqrt(2)/2,
 into a cosine of something.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:47,633
Here it is straightforward because
sqrt(2)/2 is actually equal to cos(Pi/4).

13
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:52,133
This first step is very important.
Once we had written it,

14
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:56,666
we get an equation cos()=cos().
And we have a formula

15
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:03,132
for solutions of this kind of equation.
The formula always has 2 parts as you can see.

16
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:10,599
Then we have,
2x equals Pi/4 to which we have to add 2kPi

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:20,366
or (and you have to keep in mind this "or")
2x equals minus the angle, namely -Pi/4 +2kPi.

18
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:22,599
Once you have this 2 parts,

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,833
you have to find x.

20
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:30,933
Here, you only need to divide by 2,

21
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:33,566
and be careful when you divide by 2,

22
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:42,166
Pi/4 becomes Pi/8,
but you also need to divide 2kPi by 2
which becomes kPi.

23
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:46,699
Hence we can write 
the set of the solutions of this equation,

24
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,700
like this, with 2 parts:
the first one Pi/8+kP

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,700
and the second one
-Pi/8+kP (where k is an integer).

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,800
Notice there is an infinity of solutions.

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,500
Second example with sinus.

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,600
It's the same way as before.
The first thing to do is to change this value 1/2,

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,100
to a sinus of something.

30
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:17,800
It turns out that 1/2 is sin(Pi/6).
Once we have this form, we can apply

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,200
solutions formula for sinus,
which is also

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,533
in 2 parts.
The first part is the same as for cosine:

33
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:33,733
4x equals Pi/6+2kPi.

34
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:40,733
And the second one is a little bit different:
4x equals ...

35
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:46,499
... Pi minus the angle over here, that is Pi/6
to which we add 2kPi.

36
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:54,100
One more time, you have to find x.
Therefore you need to divide these equations by 4.

37
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:00,033
Pi/6 becomes Pi/24,
and do not forget to dived 2kPi by 4

38
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:03,899
which becomes 4Pi/2.

39
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,600
We obtain the set of solutions of the equation

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,800
right there,
with an integer k.

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:20,500
Finally, a last equation.
An equation of type cos()=sin().
We don't have an explicit formula to solve this.

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,133
So how can you do ?
We're going to use symetry formula 
we've seen previously.

43
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:29,399
We can switch the sinus to a cosine,

44
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,266
(in this case, we'll get cos()=cos())
otherwise we can switch cosine to sinus

45
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:38,099
(in the latter case, we'll get sin()=sin()).

46
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,400
You have a choice to do. 
I've chosen to switch the sinus to a cosine,
and we remind

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,733
of sin(x) equals cos(x-Pi/2).

48
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:52,966
Once we had rewritten the equation,
we can apply as before

49
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,832
the solutions formula for cosine.

50
00:03:55,833 --> 00:04:04,933
It's in to 2 parts (keep in mind!). 
Therefore 2x equals the angle x-Pi/2 +2kPi

51
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:12,866
or
2x equals negative the angle, that is
-x + Pi/2 + 2kPi.

52
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:21,199
At last, you have to find x.
You put all x together (on the left hand side)

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,333
and we get only one x
has to be equal to - Pi/2 +2kPi

54
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:31,499
or
3x has to be equal to Pi/2 +2kPi.

55
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,333
There's nothing to do with the first equation.
But for the second one, you have to divide by 3

56
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,733
and we get

57
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:46,133
(right here a - sign is missing)
and we get for this side
Pi/6+2kPi/3.

58
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:48,299
The set of solutions

59
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,000
(with a - sign right here)

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,333
is equal to that.
