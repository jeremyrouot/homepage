1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800


2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,933
This first lesson is about trigonometry

3
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:08,433
We're going to talk about 3 topics: 
the first one concerns trigonometric functions

4
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:12,966
We'll talk about addition formula, 
which are the most important formula

5
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:17,599
at last, 
we'll show how to solve a trigonometric equation

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,700
Concerning trigonometric functions,

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,400
we have represented here 
what we call the trigonometric circle. 
This circle

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,100
is the circle with center O, the origin, 
and with 1 as radius.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,266
On the circle, 
we've put an angle, alpha,

10
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:41,432
in violet, 
and this angle determines a point on the circle.

11
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:46,233
This point admits coordinates. 
Its coordinates

12
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:49,099
are depending on the angle alpha.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:57,400
And its coordinates are precisely the so-called trigonometric functions, namely on the x-axis, the length over there

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,633
we define what we call the cosine of alpha

15
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:06,733
and on the y-axis, 
we define what we call the sinus of alpha.

16
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,233
We can define ...

17
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:15,766
a third trigonometric function: drawing the half-line over there,

18
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:23,032
and drawing the vertical line passing through the point (1,0).

19
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:26,533
If we take the intersection of these two straight lines

20
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:30,933
then the height in green over there

21
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,799
also depends on alpha. 
Because if I move alpha

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,666
then the height is moving too,

23
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:41,666
and this height is called the tangent of alpha.

24
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:50,799
So we can see a very important property, 
which relies the three trigonometric functions :

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,333
thanks to Thales' theorem. 
Indeed here you have a triangle

26
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:59,633
and inside of it, you can find
this segment over there

27
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,433
and this one, which are parallel.

28
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:06,366
Thales' theorem says that the quotient between

29
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:14,332
the length of this segment and the lenght of this one is equal to the quotient between the length of the segment over there

30
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,499
and the one over there.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,700
Namely,
sinus of alpha

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,400
divided by tangent of alpha is equal to cosine of alpha divided by the length of the large segment which is 1.

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,366
This can be rewritten,

34
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:37,166
this is the well-known formula, as tangent of alpha equals sinus of alpha over cosine of alpha.

35
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:41,666
This is a first and very useful property. A second property

36
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,266
comes from
the little triangle over here.

37
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:48,199
This little triangle has a 90 degrees-angle.

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,333
In this kind of triangle, 
we can apply the Pythagoras' Theorem.

39
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:55,366
It says that
the sum of the length squared 

40
00:02:55,366 --> 00:03:03,099
here and here is equal to the length squared of the larger segment. Its length equals 1

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,333
whatever the value
of alpha.

42
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:13,433
So Pythagoras' Theorem says: the length over here, sinus of x ...

43
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:21,966
... squared plus the length over here, 
cosine of x squared, is equal to 1 squared.

44
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:26,966
Finally, we can recall usual values.

45
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:31,966
We put the usual values: 
Pi/6, Pi/4, Pi/3.

46
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,066


47
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:34,999
You absolutely need to know

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,033
the cosine values of these usual values

49
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:43,899
and the sinus values too.

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:51,933
Once we know the usual values, 
how to compute other values such that sinus of -Pi/3 ?

51
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:56,533
We're going to see some symmetry properties.

52
00:03:56,533 --> 00:04:01,866
We have the trigonometric circle with an angle, called x.

53
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:08,666
Now we're looking the angle -x. 
It's going to the other side.

54
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,432
We're looking for its coordinates.

55
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:20,633
Its coordinates: 
on the x-axis, one can see that the cosine of -x, 
the length over here, is exactly the same as

56
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:26,099
the cosine of x. 
So we get a first property: 
cosine of -x equals cosine of x.

57
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,966
By contrast, the sinus of -x, 
the y-coordinate here, 

58
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:37,499
is the same length as the sinus of x, 
but with a negative sign in front of. 

59
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,066
So sinus of -x equals - sinus of x. 
This can be used to determine

60
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:51,066
this kind of value. 
For example, what is the value of sinus of -Pi/3 ?

61
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:58,099
sinus of -Pi/3 is actually - sinus of Pi/3, 
namely - the square root of 3 over 2.

62
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,700
Now, 
how to compute the cosine of 2Pi/3 ?

63
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,966
Again we need

64
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:10,799
some other symmetry properties. 
For example, with x given, we can draw

65
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,100
the angle x + Pi/2: 
I take x and turn of one quarter.

66
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,033
We get the green angle over there.

67
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:23,466
We're looking for the coordinates of this angle.

68
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:27,832
The height over here,
I can draw it,

69
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:34,766
I can see that the sinus of x+Pi/2 has actually the same value as

70
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:42,532
the cosine of x. 
We get a first relation: 
sinus of x+Pi/2 equals cosine of x.

71
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:49,166
This time, I'm interested in 
its x-coordinate.

72
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,632
I can see that the cosine of x+Pi/2

73
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:59,633
has exactly the same length as the sinus of x, but with a negative sign in front of it (because we are on the negative side over the x-axis).

74
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:06,766
We get the formula: cosine of x+Pi/2 
equals - sinus of x.

75
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:13,299
It is useful to compute this value. 
Indeed 2Pi/3 ...

76
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:20,866
can be rewritten as the sum of two angles: Pi/6 + Pi/2. 
And we know that the cosine of x

77
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:31,066
+Pi/2 is equal to - sinus of x, namely -sinus of Pi/6, 
and we finally get a well-known usual value.

78
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:35,399
We know that sinus of Pi/6 is equal to one half.
