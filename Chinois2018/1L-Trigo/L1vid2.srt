1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,933


2
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:07,633
We're going to see addition formula and a straightforward application: duplication formula.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:13,933
So the trigonometric addition formula 
are the most important amongst all trigonometric formula.

4
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:19,233
The main reason is that from these formula, 
we can deduce all the others.

5
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:23,566
Here we recall addition formula:

6
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:31,399
cosine of x+y and sinus of x+y, 
which are available for all real x and y.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,866
Be careful: cosine switch + sign to - sign

8
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:39,866
instead of sinus which keeps the same sign.

9
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:47,432
We immediately can deduce from them
the following formula, with a cosine of x minus y.

10
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:51,966
Actually we replace all of y by -y

11
00:00:51,966 --> 00:01:03,832
and we get cosine of x cosine of - y minus sinus of x sinus -y. 
Because cos(-x)=cos(x), this is the same

12
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:09,799
but sin(-y)=-sin(y), both - signs give together a + sign.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,766
We get the formula over here for cos(x-y) with a +sign.

14
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:22,532
Conversely, sin(x-y), switching all the y by -y

15
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:27,033
we get in the same way: the -sign from the sinus

16
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:32,466
is going outside et the formula follows.

17
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:38,932
You absolutely have to remember these 2 (ou 4) formula.

18
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:48,933
A first application: 
if you want to compute cos(x+Pi/3), we apply the formula, 
the +sign becomes a -sign

19
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:55,599
and we remind of the usual values of cos(Pi/3) et sin(Pi/3).

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:03,633
Namely, cosine becomes 1/2 
and sinus becomes the square root of 3 over 2.

21
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:09,699
An other and little more tricky example: 
how to compute sinus of Pi/12 ?

22
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,633
Sin(Pi/12) is not an usual value.

23
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:18,466
But we can transform these quantity into two usual values,

24
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:25,499
if we notice that Pi/12 is actually equal to 4Pi/12 - 3Pi/12.

25
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,233
It turns out that 4Pi/12=Pi/3

26
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:31,533
which is an usual value. And 3Pi/12 = Pi/4

27
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:36,933
therefore we can apply addition formula for sinus,

28
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:43,999
which gives us this, 
and all the values are well-known usual values.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,633
The result follows.

30
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:56,766
We can simplify to obtain: 
the square root of 6 minus the square root of 2, all of this over 4,
for the value of sin(Pi/12).

31
00:02:56,766 --> 00:03:01,932
Obviously, we could compute in the same way cos(Pi/12).

32
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:09,466
So a first application of addition formula 
is what we call duplication formula.

33
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:15,832
Namely, cosine of 2x is actually cosine of x+x,

34
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,599
and using the addition formula,

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,433
we get something like that: 
cosine of x squared minus sinus of x squared.

36
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,799
From this, we remind of

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:35,500
the trigonometric Pythagoras' formula, in other words: 
cos^2+sin^2=1. 
Therefore we can switch

38
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,366
the one or the other one

39
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:43,932
the cos^2 or the sin^2 
to 1-sin^2 or to 1-cos^2.

40
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:53,833
Here I switch cos^2 to 1-sin^2
and I get 1-2sin^2(x).

41
00:03:53,833 --> 00:04:02,999
Otherwise, if I switch sin^2 to 1-cos^2, 
then I get 2cos^2(x)-1.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,166
These 3 green quantities are the same, 
called duplication formula for cosine. 

43
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:19,766
At last, duplication formula for sinus: 
it is easier,

44
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:30,132
because we notice that we get 2 times cos(x)sin(x), 
and here is the duplication formula for sinus.

45
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:35,766
So we can apply these duplication formula 
in two different ways.

46
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:40,899
We're going to see this with the cosine.

47
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:49,800
Indeed, reversely,
cosine squared is equal to 1 ...

48
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,800
(if I put the 1 in the other side) 
...+ cosine of 2x, all of that above 2.

49
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:04,133
For example: let's compute cosine of Pi/8.
Again Pi/8 isn't an usual value.

50
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:07,066
So we should go back to usual values.

51
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:13,032
Cos(Pi/8) is not directly computable,
but we can compute

52
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:17,933
cos(Pi/8)^2,
using the previous formula.

53
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:25,866
cos(Pi/8)^2 equals 
cosine of 2 times Pi/8 (=Pi/4) +1
all of that over 2.

54
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:32,966
But we know the value of cos(Pi/4)
which is the square root of 2 over 2.

55
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:40,899
Hence cos(Pi/8)^2 is finally equal 
to the square root of 2 +2, over 2.

56
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,900
The last thing to do is 
to take the square root of these quantities.

57
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,300
Be careful, 
the square root of a^2 is not a.

58
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,700
Actually the square root of a^2 
is the absolute value of a.

59
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,133
It depends on whether 
a is a positive or a negative number.

60
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:07,666
Here Pi/8 is between 0 and Pi/2,

61
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,266
therefore cos(Pi/8) is necessarly positive.

62
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:16,932
Hence the square root of cos(Pi/8)^2
is equal to cos(Pi/8).

63
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:24,166
It is the square root of all of that.
