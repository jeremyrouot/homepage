1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600


2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,400
In this course,
we're going to talk about derivative functions.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:12,933
In this first video, we'll be interested in tangent lines.
For that, we need the concept of derivative number.

4
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:18,633
Then we'll give 
the general tangent line equation.

5
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:27,166
On the picture, we've drawn
in green the graphe of some function
(here is the sinus function),

6
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:36,532
on which we've put a first point A.
And we have in red the tangent line to the graph

7
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:44,233
of f that passes through the point A.
The tangent line is the best line 
which approches the green graph to A.

8
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:52,066
We've put a second point B,
right here over the graph.

9
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:57,566
Finally we've drawn the blue line
which passes through A and B.

10
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:03,066
The first question you can ask is:
what is the slope of the blue line?

11
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:10,766
It's well-known: 
the slope of the blue line
is the slope between A and B.

12
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:19,699
And the value is well-known:
f(b) minus f(a) all over b minus a.

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,366
Now, let's move
the point B to the point A.

14
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:31,532
If we do this, we notice
that the blue line

15
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:38,566
is coming closer
of the red line, which is the tangent line.

16
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:43,399
Taking the limit, 
both of lines are superposed.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,100
It means

18
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:52,200
that we can find
the slope of the red tangent line.

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:00,066
Actually, because B comes closer to A,
the slope of the tangent line simply is

20
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:11,299
the limit when b tends to a
of the slope between A and B.

21
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:19,966
This limit has a name:
the derivative number of 
the function f at a.

22
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:26,666
It has a name but also a notation:
it's denoted by f '(a).

23
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:33,566
All of this gives us the slope of the tangent line,
but the complete tangent line equation is missing.

24
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:39,632
The complete tangent line equation
can be easily found:

25
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:45,366
this is the one over here:
the tangent line equation

26
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:49,799
to the graph of f at a.

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,933
Let's do some computation.
Let f be the sinus function.

28
00:02:55,933 --> 00:03:04,466
We want to determine
the tangent line equation to f at (0,0).

29
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:08,066
To this aim, 
I need to compute the derivative.

30
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:17,799
The derivative of sinus is cosine.
Then I take the derivative at 0, and I get 1.
The 1 over here

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,333
is actually the slope of the tangent line.

32
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:29,399
Now I can find the other part of the equation.

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,633
I deduce that the tangent line
to the graph of f at (0,0)

34
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:37,166
(f(0) equals 0)

35
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:45,866
has its equation:
y equals 1 times (x minus 0) plus f(0)

36
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:48,499
namely y equals x.
