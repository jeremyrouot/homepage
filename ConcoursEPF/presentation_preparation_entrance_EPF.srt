00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,200
Welcome in this preparation of the examination entrance

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,900
of the EPF Graduate School of Engineering

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,800
My name is Jeremy Rouot and I am a mathematics teacher at EPF

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,400
and I will accompany you during this preparation 

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,600
In this video, I will present you the contents of this formation

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,600
with the different courses and the Moodle platform, 

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,000
due to which we will communicate all together,

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:38,000
to access of the different pdf files and video files of the courses,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and also to provide you some tests to see if you reached the requirements of the lessons

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's begin to access this platform:

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
type the address http://moodle.epf.fr/

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
you reach this page where you can put

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
your id and your password, which were given to you 

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
After logging in, you get a series of courses and you should see the course

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
"SPOC Concours EPF"  You click on this link 

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I will switch on the student mode so that you will see the same page as me 

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Here on the course's page, you can change the language to english 

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You have a first link to download a presentation's video of EPF Troyes, 

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
which was made by Chinese students at EPF 

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Click on the link to download the zip archive on your computer

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and extract it to have the video file 

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Then I let you enjoy this video 

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You have one link where you will be able to introduce yourself 

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can create a new discussion: for instance I introduced myself here

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
that is, I am Jérémy Rouot, math teacher at EPF

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:03:00,000
My hobby is bikes and I give you a QR code to add me on WeChat 

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I invite you to create a discussion to speak a bit about yourself here 

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can either ask to me your question on WeChat or if you want to share your question

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can post a topic to present your problem that you encountered 

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's come back on the main page of the course 

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You have a first section about how to answer questions of this preparation 

32
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:09,000
Indeed there will be tests and you will be told to respect a syntax so that your answers can be correct 

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We will come back to it after 

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This second section is the first chapter of the preparation and concerns Trigonometry 	

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Each course is organized as follows: you have the competencies that you should get at the end of this chapter 

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You have links to download the pdf file of the course about Trigonometry

37
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and to download videos related to this lesson 

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
As before, you have to download the zip archive on your computer 

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and to extract it to have access to the videos of the course 

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Once you finished to work on the pdf file and the video files 

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,500
You can train yourself with several tests  

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You can do these tests as many of times as you want  You won't have marked on these tests 

43
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
At each different attempts, questions are not the same, so do not hesitate to do tests several times 

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
For instance, I entered in this test and I selected one question 

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This test has 15 questions, and in the twelfth question I am told to expand the expression

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
(sine of minus 5 times r minus pi) in terms of (sine of 5 times r) or (cosine of 5 times r)

47
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The answer to this question is (sine of 5 times r)

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How to enter correctly (sine of 5 times r)?

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:07,700
To help you, this "Sheet summary"'s file contains different mathematical expressions 

50
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,000
and the corresponding expressions to enter in Moodle 

51
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
For instance, for the sine function, to enter sine of 2 times pi times beta, 

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You must enter (sine of 2 times "p" "i" and "b" "e" "t" "a")

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Indeed the pi number is indicated here as "p" "i" and the Greek letter beta is entered as "b" "e" "t" "a" 

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Finally the sine function can be entered as "s" "i" "n" "bracket"

55
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and you enter the input in the brackets  Here the input of the sine function is 5 times r 

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I enter "5" "asterisk" because "asterisk" is the multiplication symbol

57
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Below your answer box is displayed the mathematical expression corresponding to what you entered 

58
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Namely, if you forgot a bracket, one indicates that your answer is not valid  

59
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Indeed it specifies to add a closing bracket 

60
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Careful, this displayed expression may be not correct  It is just an interpretation of what you entered and it could be incorrect 

61
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If I add "plus" "1", it would have displayed the corresponding expression 

62
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Then you can pass to the next question to reach a new question 

63
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
In this question you have to choose the correct answer among four potential answers 

64
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You can go back to the previous question if you want to modify it 

65
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
To validate all your answers, you click here "Finish attempt"

66
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and you can send all your answers to the system and you get a summary of your test 

67
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I did not answer to the first question and it yields the right mathematical answer and the right syntax to enter it 

68
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,000
For instance (minus square root of three over 2), from this file 

69
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:49,000
the square root function should be entered as "s" "q" "r" "t" and the input is inside  brackets  

70
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
To get used to with this syntax, I strongly advice you to have a look at the first section,

71
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
which will train you to answer correctly to the questions 

72
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The first link gives you instructions on this syntax to answer correctly to the questions 

73
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The number pi can be entered as "p" "i" or with a percentage symbol "%" in front 

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The multiplication symbol is the "asterisk", the power function, the brackets 

75
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
as soon as you have a rational expression, you should not forget brackets 

76
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can read this page and if you encounter mathematical object that you don't understand such as matrices, you can skip it 

77
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The second link refers to a quiz, which is not evaluated  You can do it several times because most questions are random 

78
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And this quiz is the perfect exercise to get used to with the specific syntax to enter mathematical expressions 

79
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Keep this "Sheet summary" next to you as soon as you are answering questions on Moodle 

80
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This point concerns Greek letters, to enter the Greek letter "alpha" you must type "a" "l" "p" "h" "a" 

81
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Concerning the test of the first section, the first part is informative

82
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
To enter "x" at the power minus 2, you have to enter "x" "hat" "bracket" "-2" "bracket" 

83
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,000
In question 1, you are told to enter the expression corresponding to "y" equals to "3" times "x" plus "5"

84
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So I enter "y" "=" "3" "*" "+" "5"

85
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Below the answer box, your answer is interpretated and displayed with mathematical symbols

86
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Once you are satisfied, you may pass on the next question  We skip the question 2 

87
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The third question concerns Greek letters  Here you have to enter the expression 

88
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,400
"alpha" times exponential of "pi" times "x"

89
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,000
"alpha" is a Greek letter and you may refer here or to your sheet summary

90
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
To enter the letter "alpha" you have to type "a" "l" "p" "h" "a"

91
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let's enter it  "a" "l" "p" "h" "a" "*" exponential of pi times x

92
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The exponential function can be entered as "e" "x" "p" and the input is between brackets 

93
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So "e" "x" "p" and in brackets we put "pi" times "x" 

94
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Likewise "pi" can be entered as "p" "i"  So "p" "i" "*" "x" and I close the brackets 

95
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Once you finished you get an interpretation of what you entered and if you forgot a bracket, it will tell you 

96
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Once again, the displayed expression here corresponds to what you entered in the answer box and may be not the correct answer 

97
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You may have added "x" at the power "2" and it doesn't tell you if it's right or wrong  

98
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Then you can jump to the following questions  

99
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Train yourself on this quiz and keep this sheet summary next to you!

100
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
This presentation is about to finish

101
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If you have any question (mathematical or concerning Moodle or how to answer questions),

102
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,500
Please do not hesitate to send me a message either on Moodle or via WeChat 

103
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:45,000
I wish you all the best for this week and I am looking forward to seeing you at EPF!
